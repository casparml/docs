## Description

Rotational reset times are used to define when rotational stats roll over. For more information on rotational stats, see [Rotational Stats](/features/rotational-stats/).

Reset times can be configure to include a GMT offset, reset hour, and reset minute, allowing for more control over when rotational stats roll over.

**GMT Offset**: The GMT offset to use for the reset time. For example, -5 would be UTC-5.\
**Reset Hour**: The hour to reset rotational stats.\
**Reset Minute**: The minute to reset rotational stats.


:::note
Because automatic rotational resetting is now restricted to <a href="https://statalytics.net/premium" target="_blank">Statalytics Pro users</a>, setting a reset time will otherwise have no effect.

For more information, see [Rotational Stats](/features/rotational-stats/).
