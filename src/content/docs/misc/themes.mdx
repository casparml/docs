## Description

Themes can be used to change the appearance of images output by the bot.

There are two types of themes: voter themes and exclusive themes.


### Voter Themes

Voter themes are unlocked by voting for Statalytics on bot listing sites **or with a premium plan**.

For more information on voting, see [Voting](http://localhost:4321/misc/voting/).


### Exclusive Themes

Exclusive themes can't be unlocked, they may be awarded to users by Statalytics staff. Exclusive themes may be awarded to users on special occasions or for special events.
