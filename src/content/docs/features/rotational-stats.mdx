## Description

Rotational stats track daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly stats over time. Past rotational stats are also accessible via commands.

## Resetting

There are two ways that rotational stats can be reset: manually triggered and automatically triggered.

##### Manually Triggered

Manually triggered rotational stat resetting occurs when a player's Hypixel stats are checked for the first time after a day, week, month, or year has passed.

##### Automatically Triggered

Automatically triggered rotational stat resetting happens automatically at a certain reset time. For more information on reset times, see [Reset Time](/settings/reset-time/).

:::note
Due to limitations with Hypixel's API policy, automatic rotational resetting is now restricted to <a href="https://statalytics.net/premium" target="_blank">Statalytics Pro users</a>.
